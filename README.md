A Pokémon-oriented Discord bot that lets you collect pokémon. Catch pokémon in the wild, level your pokémon, compete with your friends, and more.

The source code here is provided for educational purposes. I would recommend against running your own instance of this bot. Instead, use `p!invite` and click the link to add the bot to your server.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions. Please, however, make an issue first if you want to contribute to the bot.

Right now, the code's still quite convoluted. I am working on refactoring and reorganizing the project.
